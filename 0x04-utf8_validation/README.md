0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Description
This project focuses on validating UTF-8 encoded data. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. The goal of this project is to write a function that determines if a given data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Objectives
Understand the principles of UTF-8 encoding.

Implement a function to validate UTF-8 encoded data.

Handle edge cases and ensure the solution is efficient.

Validation Criteria
The function validUTF8(data) will:

Take a list of integers as input.

Return True if the data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding, False otherwise.

Check that each integer falls within the appropriate byte range for UTF-8 encoding.

Example
Given the data set:

[197, 130, 1] represents valid UTF-8 encoding.

[235, 140, 4] does not represent valid UTF-8 encoding.
